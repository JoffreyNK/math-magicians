      Combinatorial analysis, in the trivial sense of manipulating binomial and
      multinomial coefficients, and formally expanding powers of infinite series
      by applications ad libitum and ad nauseamque of the multinomial theorem,
      represented the best that academic mathematics could do in the Germany of
      the late 18th century.

      If a religion is defined to be a system of ideas that contains
      unprovable statements, then GÃ¶del taught us that mathematics is not only a
      religion, it is the only religion that can prove itself to be one.
